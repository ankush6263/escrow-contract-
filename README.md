# Escrow Contract

## Project Description

The Escrow Contract is a secure and trustless smart contract solution built on Solidity that facilitates safe transactions between buyers and sellers on the blockchain. This decentralized escrow service eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries by using smart contract automation and optional arbitration to ensure fair transactions for all parties involved.

The contract implements a robust escrow mechanism where funds are held securely until delivery is confirmed, with built-in dispute resolution capabilities and automatic refund processes for enhanced user protection.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure marketplace infrastructure that enables trustless commerce on the blockchain. By eliminating the need for centralized escrow services, we aim to reduce transaction costs, increase transparency, and provide global access to secure trading mechanisms.

We envision a future where peer-to-peer transactions are conducted with complete confidence, backed by immutable smart contract logic that protects both buyers and sellers while maintaining the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
